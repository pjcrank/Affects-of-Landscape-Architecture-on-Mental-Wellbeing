# Dissertation Proposal -- Chapters 3 and 4 Outline
**A. How is the landscape designed?**  
Humans have taken an active role in shaping their environments, most noticeably
where human populations gather and interact. These spaces historically have been
the epicenters of human activity. Yet the drastic re-writing on the surface of
the earth has only recently begun to be regarded as something that should
preserve the non-human landscapes as beneficial to humans rather than
burdensome. To that aim, architects begun recreating urban spaces to include
the natural and native features that pre-dated human influence in the space.
The growing number of concerned architects led to the earliest environmentalism
movements in the Western European societies.  
	*a. to improve thermal comfort (reduce air temperature and mean radiant
		temperature)*  
Howard (in England) and Olmsted (in the United States) led the movement on
interspersing green spaces within the urban cities of England and the U.S.
Their work was not only focused on the environmental and ecological benefits of
re-connecting the natural world, their visions explicitly endeavoured to
improve the quality of life and wellbeing of the city-dweller. The town-country
magnet of Ebenezer Howard's vision included attractive features drawing the
city-dweller to this garden city such as: "No Sweating", "Pure Air and Water",
"Good Drainage", "No Smoke", and "Bright Homes and Gardens". The style of
writing masks to the 21st century reader to the underlying issues associated
with the urban form and urban climate that was being addressed in his
town-country model. Howard's efforts were focused on improving the urban climate
of the city by creating a "garden city" that allowed the city-dweller to
experience important health benefits that were unavailable within the city due
to the form of the urban city center. He envisioned life for the city-dweller
to allow for cooler air temperatures (no sweating), better ventilation (pure
air and water, no smoke), improved sanitation and healthier indoor conditions
(bright homes and gardens, good drainage). Today, we use landscape architecture
to create urban form that continues to improve these same issues for the
city-dweller.

Olmsted proffered similar approaches to the city in the United States of
America. His "Emerald Necklace" in and around Boston, Massachusetts took similar
concepts about nature and the benefits to the urban population by having a
natural landscape to escape from city life. Yet, both of these planners not
only were focused on the physical improvements to the city and the city-dweller.
There are mental wellbeing concerns woven into the fabric of these arguments.
They were convinced that increased contact with the natural world improves
mental wellbeing from depression to even less understood issues such
schizophrenia and other mentally manic disorders.  
	*b. to improve mental wellbeing*  
Research over the past 150 years has indicated concerns regarding mental
wellbeing (including schizophrenia) being negatively affected by urban areas.
From U.S. 1840 census questions inquiring into the number of "crazy" persons
in a household to more modern approaches that statistically analyze differences
in schizophrenia based on location of birth (Vassos et al., 2016), there is
evidence suggesting that there is a detrimental relationship between the city
and the mental wellbeing of the city-dweller. Howard also attempted to address
this in his town-country magnet. Howard identified the city featuring
"isolation of crowds", "crowded dwellings" and an assortment of stressful
environmental and social factors that he believed an increase in contact with
nature counteract.    
	*c. to increase contact with green space and green infrastructure*  
	Clearly, Howard and Olmsted thought the best approach to improving urban
society's quality of life is through improved atmospheric conditions, but also
via increased direct contact with the natural, non-human world that had been
(and to some extent, still is) removed from the urban areas of society. Yet,
there is growing concern for ecological gentrification. Ecological
gentrification is the phenomenon of gentrification that occurs to increases in
green infrastructure and space (Dooling, 2009; Wolch et al., 2014). There is a
fine line between providing enough eco-services and causing a gentrification of
a neighborhood due to the popularity and abundance of green space and eco-
services that supplants the local population with wealthier people who want the
location for proximity as well as green space.  

**B. How has landscape architecture approached these goals historically?**  
Historically speaking, these challenges have been met with opposition. Greed
and other ulterior motives have hijacked the ideals of Olmsted, Howard, and
others, resulting in some successes in the implementation of green space. Yet,
these ulterior motives are likely a component of the gentrification and
supplanting of local populations with new, wealthier constituents. Thus, any
improvement of the local climate and design for improving thermal comfort and
mental wellbeing has been seized by the wealthier populations and the
vulnerable are moved to locations that have not seen such improvements and thus
the cycle continues without improvement for the vulnerable populations.

**C. What are some avenues to increase each of these avenues for positive
neighborhood attitudes?**  

**D. Application to the current Edison-Eastlake neighborhood.**  
	*a. Testing of strategies through micro-climate modeling*  
	*b. Discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of different mitigation
	strategies in their ability to balance improvements of different goals.*  

**E. Extreme heat and Schizophrenia**  
	*a. What are the best approaches to reducing the environmental exposure to
	stressors for schizophrenic crises and episodes?*  
The medical research continues to point to the importance of the hypothalamus
for thermoregulation. This includes evidence that supports a blockage in the
neurotransmission resulting in fatigue, hyperthermia, and hypothermia during
exercise and in varying ambient thermal environments (Meussen et al., 2010;
Roeland et al., 2010). Therefore, reducing ambient stressors such as extreme
heat or extreme cold can reduce fatigue and improve the brain's ability to
manage the transmission of information and regulation of the body. Additionally,
there is some research to suggest that the amount of sunshine and solar
radiation a person is exposed to can influence the likelihood of manic episodes
of which, schizophrenia is related; however, studies have only looked at manic
depressive and manic bipolar patients and incidents (Lee et al., 2002; Volpe et
al., 2006). This points to a reduction in Mean Radiant Temperature (MRT) may
further improve the ambient environment for schizophrenia than simply reducing air
temperature.  
	*b. How does landscape architecture help/hurt the schizophrenic population
		in Phoenix?*  
If reducing ambient stressors can improve the landscape of schizophrenia in
Phoenix, then it is paramount to landscape architecture to provide structures
that ease the burden on this vulnerable population. Many low-income, affordable
housing, and transient populations are unable to choose their thermal conditions.
This population also appears to overlap with the schizophrenic population. The
design of urban form becomes essential to reducing the ambient stressors to
causing schizophrenic episodes. While the ambient environment is not the only
cause of schizophrenic crises, it does provide ways for easing the burden of
this population while also benefiting the general public at the same time. If
MRT is the better option to improving the thermal environment for schizophrenia,
then Phoenix is a very dangerous locale for individuals with the disorder.  
	*c. Are strategies that maximize thermal comfort also aiding in reducing the
		environmental exposure to schizophrenia crises stressors?*  
Could MRT reductions be the best approach to analyzing the impact of mitigation
strategies for the schizophrenic population?
